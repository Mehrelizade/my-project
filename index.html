            <h2>What Is BHAG?</h2>
            
            <p>
                BHAG is a goal created for independent thinking and differentiation. Coined in the book "Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" by James Collins and Jerry Porras, the fundamental essence of this terminology is to set the long-term goals of an organization with the purpose of ensuring its development, attracting employees, and making strategic decisions. BHAG is typically defined for a period of 10-25 years and is utilized to guide the overall development of the organization.
